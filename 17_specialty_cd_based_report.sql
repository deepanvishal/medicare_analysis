-- STEP 1: ref_specialty_crosswalk
-- WHAT:   Maps CMS 422.116 specialty names to Aetna internal
--         specialty codes. One CMS specialty can map to multiple
--         Aetna codes and vice versa.
-- WHY:    Aetna and CMS use different specialty coding systems.
--         This crosswalk is the bridge for all downstream joins.

-- STEP 3: ref_county_classification
-- WHAT:   Classifies all 67 Florida counties into CMS county
--         types: Large Metro, Metro, Micro, Rural, CEAC.
--         Also stores compliance threshold (90% or 85%) and

-- WHY:    County type drives which distance + ratio thresholds
--         apply per 42 CFR 422.116. Compliance threshold
--         determines pass/fail in fact_gap_analysis.

-- STEP 6: ref_hsd_required_counts
-- WHAT:   Exact required provider and facility counts per
--         Florida county per specialty. Sourced directly from
--         CMS 2026 HSD Reference File (published 12-17-2025).
-- WHY:    Replaces approximated ratio-based calculation.
--         CMS uses 95th percentile base population ratio which
--         we cannot derive from available data. This table
--         gives us the exact numbers CMS uses for compliance.
-- SOURCE: CMS 2026 HSD Reference File
--         https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-drug-plans/

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 7: stg_beneficiaries
-- WHAT:   Demand side table. One row per Florida zip code with
--         total population (ACS 2018) and county context
--         including CMS Medicare eligible counts.
-- WHY:    Population is the demand measure. Used in:
--         - fact_zip_access: bene zip is the center point
--           for distance calculation
--         - fact_gap_analysis: population denominator for
--           pct_covered calculation
-- NOTE:   lat/long NOT stored here. Joined from ref_zip_reference
--         at distance calculation time only.
--         county_eligibles from CMS penetration file used as
--         denominator for HSD required count validation only.

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 9: fact_zip_access
-- WHAT:   For each beneficiary zip × CMS specialty × plan type,
--         counts how many contracted providers exist within
--         the CMS maximum distance threshold.
--         Tags each zip as has_access = TRUE/FALSE.
-- WHY:    This is the core distance compliance computation.
--         CMS requires that X% of beneficiaries in each county
--         have at least 1 provider within the distance threshold.
--         This table answers "does this zip have access?"
--         fact_gap_analysis then rolls this up to county level.
-- NOTE:   SPARSE TABLE - only rows where at least 1 provider
--         exists within threshold are stored.
--         Zips with zero access are handled in fact_gap_analysis
--         via LEFT JOIN from all_combinations CTE.
--         Threshold lookup uses BENEFICIARY county type per
--         42 CFR 422.116 - not provider county type.
--         ST_DISTANCE returns meters, divided by 1609.34 for miles.
